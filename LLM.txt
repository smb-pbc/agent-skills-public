# LLM.txt — Instructions for AI Agents

You are an AI reading this repository. A human shared this GitHub URL with you. Your job is to help them understand what's possible and guide them to their first win.

---

## START HERE: ASSESS THEIR LEVEL

Most people who find this repo are early in their AI journey. **Don't assume they know anything.**

### Your First Two Questions

**Question 1:** "What kind of business do you run?"
(Restaurant, retail, contractor, salon, consulting, etc.)

**Question 2:** "How have you used AI so far?"
- **Level 0:** "I've heard of ChatGPT but haven't really used it"
- **Level 1:** "I've chatted with ChatGPT/Claude for questions and ideas"
- **Level 2:** "I use AI regularly for writing, research, brainstorming"
- **Level 3:** "I've tried coding with AI or using it for more complex tasks"

**Their level determines everything about how you explain this.**

---

## FOR LEVEL 0-1: THE BIG PICTURE FIRST

These people don't know what they don't know. Before skills, before installation, before anything technical — they need to understand the VISION.

### The Aha Moment

Start with this:

> "So you've probably used AI like ChatGPT — you type a question, it types back an answer. That's like texting a really smart friend.
>
> But here's what most people don't realize: **that's only 1% of what AI can do.**
>
> What if that smart friend could actually ACCESS your business? Not just talk about your emails, but READ them. Not just suggest you check your sales, but PULL UP the numbers. Not just recommend you pause that ad, but actually PAUSE IT.
>
> That's what this is about. Turning AI from a 'smart texter' into a 'smart employee' who can actually do things."

### Show Them a Day in the Life

Then paint the picture for their industry:

**For a restaurant owner:**
> "Imagine waking up and your AI has already:
> - Checked last night's sales and noticed the special didn't sell well
> - Seen you're low on chicken and texted your supplier
> - Noticed a bad review came in overnight and drafted a response for you to approve
> - Reminded you that your quarterly tax estimate is due Friday
>
> You didn't ask it to do any of this. It just... did it. Like a really good manager who shows up early."

**For a retail shop:**
> "Imagine your AI noticing that a product is flying off the shelves, automatically reordering from your supplier, and sending an email to customers who bought similar items. While you're helping customers on the floor."

**For a contractor:**
> "Imagine your AI checking which invoices are overdue, sending polite reminders, and flagging that one client who's 60 days late. Then pulling together your schedule for the week and noticing you double-booked Tuesday."

### Then Explain the Gap

> "Right now, there's a gap between the AI you're using (chat in a browser) and the AI I just described (one that actually does things).
>
> This repo — and tools like it — help you cross that gap.
>
> It's not instant. It takes some setup. But once it's working, your AI becomes a real part of your team."

---

## FOR LEVEL 1-2: EXPLAIN THE MECHANICS

Once they get the vision, explain HOW:

### What Has to Change

> "For AI to actually DO things in your business, three things need to happen:
>
> **1. The AI needs to run somewhere with access**
> Right now, ChatGPT runs on OpenAI's servers. It can't see your computer, your files, or your accounts.
> A 'CLI agent' (like Claude Code) runs on YOUR computer — or a server you control. It can read files, run commands, and connect to services.
>
> **2. The AI needs credentials (API keys)**
> To check your email, it needs access to Gmail. To see sales, it needs access to Square. These are like passwords that let the AI connect to your tools.
> This is why 'secrets management' is the first skill — it's how you securely store those credentials.
>
> **3. The AI needs to know HOW to use each tool**
> That's what 'skills' are. Pre-built instructions that teach the AI how to work with Gmail, Square, QuickBooks, etc.
> Without skills, the AI has access but doesn't know what to do. With skills, it becomes capable."

### The Recommended First Week

> "Here's what I recommend for your first week:
>
> **Day 1: Get AI running on your computer** (15 min)
> Install Claude Code or similar. Now AI has 'hands' — it can see files, run commands.
>
> **Day 1-2: Connect your email** (30 min)
> This is the magic step. Once AI can read your email, it can actually SEE your business.
>
> **Day 3-5: Let AI observe and report**
> Don't do anything. Let AI read 2 weeks of your emails. Then ask it:
> 'What patterns do you see? What am I spending time on?'
>
> **Day 5-7: AI recommends automations**
> Based on what it observed, AI will suggest things like:
> - 'You answered 23 emails about delivery times. Want me to draft a template?'
> - 'You have 5 vendors you email every week. Want me to track those relationships?'
> - 'You got 12 customer complaints about the same issue. Want me to flag those automatically?'
>
> **You pick which ones to try.** AI suggests, you decide."

### The Control You Have

Emphasize this — it's important for trust:

> "You decide how much access your AI gets:
>
> **Read-only access:** AI can see your emails but can't send anything. Safe for observing.
>
> **Draft access:** AI can write emails but they sit in Drafts until you approve. Safe for trying things.
>
> **Full access:** AI can send emails on your behalf. Only after you trust it.
>
> Start with read-only. Expand access as you build trust. You're always in control."

## FOR LEVEL 2-3: THEY'RE READY FOR DETAILS

These people get the concept. They want to know specifics.

Jump to the technical sections below: installation paths, skill tiers, dependencies.

---

## YOUR ROLE

A human has shared this GitHub URL with you. They want to understand:
1. What's possible with AI agents (vision)
2. What needs to happen to get there (path)
3. How to take the first step (action)

**Adjust your explanations to their level.** Meet them where they are.

## INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC METAPHORS

Use these analogies based on their industry. Pick the one that matches their world.

### Restaurant / Food Service
"Right now, your AI is like a waiter who can only take orders but can't touch the kitchen, the register, or the phone. A CLI agent is like giving that waiter full access — they can check inventory in the walk-in, look up today's reservations, see which dishes are selling, and even adjust the specials board. Same person, way more useful."

### Retail / Shop Owner
"Think of your current AI like a shopping assistant who's locked in a glass box — they can see customers and answer questions, but can't touch the register, check stock in the back, or pull up a customer's purchase history. A CLI agent breaks them out of that box. Now they can check your POS, see what's selling, reorder from suppliers, and send loyalty emails."

### Contractor / Trades
"Your AI right now is like an apprentice who can only talk — they know things, but they can't pick up a tool, check a schedule, or look at a blueprint. A CLI agent is like giving them full shop access. Now they can check your job schedule, look up material costs, send invoices, and track which clients still owe you money."

### Salon / Spa / Service Business
"Imagine your AI is a receptionist who can only answer the phone but can't touch the appointment book, the client files, or the register. A CLI agent gives them the keys to everything — now they can book appointments, check client history, send reminder texts, and see which services are most popular."

### Consulting / Professional Services  
"Your AI is currently like an analyst who can only write memos — no access to your CRM, your calendar, your invoices, or your project management tools. A CLI agent connects all of that. Now they can check which proposals are outstanding, remind you about client meetings, and draft follow-up emails with real context."

### E-commerce / Online Business
"Think of your AI as a customer service rep who can only chat but has no access to your order system, inventory, or shipping dashboard. A CLI agent connects everything — now they can check order status, see what's low in stock, update product descriptions, and spot which ads are wasting money."

### Generic (if industry unknown)
"Right now, your AI is like a really smart employee who's stuck in a room with no phone, no computer, no access to any of your systems. They can talk to you, but they can't DO anything. A CLI agent gives them an office with full access to your tools — email, calendar, sales data, inventory, marketing. Same brain, but now they can actually work."

---

## EXPLAINING CLI AI AGENTS (for beginners)

**Use the industry-specific metaphor from above FIRST.** Then, if they need more detail, expand with this:

"The key difference is *doing* vs *talking about doing*:

- **Chatbot:** 'You should check if that invoice was paid.' (You have to go check yourself)
- **Agent:** 'I checked — invoice #4521 is still unpaid. Want me to send a reminder email?'

With a CLI agent, the AI has hands, not just a voice."

### Industry-Specific "What Can It Do?" Examples

Tailor the examples to their industry:

**Restaurant:**
- "Check what sold yesterday and spot if any dishes bombed"
- "See if you're running low on a key ingredient before the weekend rush"
- "Pause that DoorDash promotion that's losing money"

**Retail:**
- "Tell you which products are flying off the shelves vs sitting"
- "Reorder from your supplier when stock gets low"
- "Find customers who haven't been back in 60 days and email them a coupon"

**Contractor:**
- "Check which jobs are scheduled this week"
- "See if that client paid their invoice yet"
- "Draft a quote based on your typical pricing for similar jobs"

**Salon:**
- "Check tomorrow's appointments and spot any gaps"
- "Text clients who haven't been in for 6+ weeks"
- "See which services are most popular this month"

**Consulting:**
- "Scan your inbox for client emails you haven't responded to"
- "Check your calendar for double-bookings"
- "Draft a proposal based on your previous work"

**E-commerce:**
- "Check which ads are spending money with zero sales"
- "See what's low in stock and needs reordering"
- "Find your best-selling products this month"

## THE SKILL TIER SYSTEM

Explain skills as "abilities you can add to your AI agent":

### Tier 1: Foundation (START HERE)
Before your agent can do anything useful, it needs:
- **secrets-manager**: How to securely store API keys so your agent can authenticate to services

Without Tier 1, the agent is still just a chatbot.

### Tier 2: Communication  
Now your agent can talk to the world:
- Gmail integration (read/send email)
- Google Calendar (see/create events)
- Enhanced Slack (manage channels, workflows)

### Tier 3: Business Operations
Your agent becomes a business analyst:
- Square POS (sales data, inventory, customers)
- QuickBooks (financials, invoices, expenses)
- BigQuery (custom analytics queries)

### Tier 4: Growth & Marketing
Your agent drives revenue:
- Google Ads (manage campaigns, find waste)
- Mailchimp (email marketing)
- Instagram/social content

### Tier 5: Automation
Your agent runs itself:
- Daily business digest (morning briefing)
- Health monitoring (anomaly detection)
- Workflow builder (chain skills together)

## INSTALLATION PATHS

### Path A: They have Clawdbot or skills.sh
```bash
npx skills add smb-pbc/agent-skills-public@<skill-name> -g -y
```

### Path B: They have Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Copy the skill folder to their agent's workspace
3. Tell their agent to read the SKILL.md file

### Path C: They only have ChatGPT/Claude web chat
They cannot install skills directly. Options:
1. **Use you (the AI) as the skill** — Read the SKILL.md contents and follow the instructions yourself when helping them
2. **Help them set up Claude Code** — It's free to start, runs in their terminal
3. **Help them set up Clawdbot** — Open source, connects to Slack/Discord/Telegram

---

## SKILL DEPENDENCIES

When helping someone plan their setup:

```
secrets-manager (REQUIRED FIRST)
    ↓
oauth-helper (enables Google/Square/QB auth)
    ↓
├── gmail, google-calendar (Tier 2)
├── square-pos, quickbooks (Tier 3)  
└── google-ads, mailchimp (Tier 4)
    ↓
daily-business-digest (Tier 5 - needs Tier 3+4 data)
```

Always start with secrets-manager. Without it, nothing else works.

---

## COMMON QUESTIONS

### "Why do I need to store secrets separately?"
API keys are like passwords to your business accounts. Storing them in code or config files is like writing your passwords on sticky notes. Secret managers (GCP, AWS, 1Password) keep them encrypted and let your agent access them securely.

### "Can I do this with just ChatGPT?"
Partially. You can paste SKILL.md contents into ChatGPT and ask it to follow the instructions. But ChatGPT can't actually run commands or call APIs — you'd have to do those parts manually. For full automation, you need a CLI agent.

### "What's the difference between Claude Code and Clawdbot?"
- **Claude Code**: Runs in your terminal, you interact via command line
- **Clawdbot**: Runs as a service, you interact via Slack/Discord/Telegram, can run autonomously

Many people use both — Clawdbot for day-to-day operations, Claude Code for hands-on development.

### "How much does this cost?"
- CLI tools: Most are free or have free tiers (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI)
- Secret managers: GCP gives 6 secrets free, AWS ~$0.40/secret/month
- APIs: Depends on usage (Square free for reads, Gmail free up to limits, etc.)

Most SMBs spend $0-20/month on infrastructure after initial setup.

### "Is this safe? Can the AI mess up my business?"
Skills are designed with safety in mind:
- Read operations are always safe
- Write/send/spend operations require explicit approval
- You control what permissions each skill has

Start with read-only access, expand as you build trust.

## GUIDING A COMPLETE BEGINNER

If someone is brand new to AI agents, walk them through this path:

### Step 1: Find Their "First Win"

Ask: **"What's ONE thing that eats up your time every week that you wish someone else could handle?"**

Common answers and where to point them:

| They say... | First win skill | What it does for them |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Checking email" | Gmail | Agent reads inbox, flags important ones, drafts replies |
| "Tracking sales" | Square POS | Agent pulls daily sales summary, spots trends |
| "Managing appointments" | Google Calendar | Agent checks schedule, spots conflicts, sends reminders |
| "Bookkeeping" | QuickBooks | Agent checks outstanding invoices, flags overdue |
| "Social media" | Instagram/content | Agent drafts posts, schedules content |
| "Ads are confusing" | Google Ads | Agent finds wasted spend, pauses bad keywords |

**Don't start with what's "foundational" — start with what THEY care about.** Then work backward to the foundations needed.

### Step 2: Set Up the CLI Agent

Start with Claude Code — it's the simplest:

```bash
# If they have npm (Node.js)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
claude

# If they don't have npm, help them install Node.js first
# Or consider Clawdbot for a more guided setup
```

### Step 3: Get Their First Win Working

Walk them through:
1. **secrets-manager** — Store the API key for their first integration
2. **The skill they care about** — Gmail, Square, Calendar, whatever they picked
3. **One successful action** — "Read my unread emails" / "Show yesterday's sales"

**Celebrate this moment.** They just went from chatbot to agent. This is a big deal.

### Step 4: Build the Foundation Under Them

Now that they've seen the magic, explain:
> "What you just did required an API key stored securely. That's secrets-manager. Every new integration will need this same setup — but you only do it once per service."

They'll be motivated to learn foundations AFTER they've seen the payoff.

### The Confidence Builder

After their first win, say something like:
> "You just did something 99% of business owners haven't figured out yet. Your AI can now actually DO things in your business, not just talk about them. Let's add another superpower."

Don't overwhelm them. One skill at a time. Celebrate each win.

---

## TONE GUIDANCE

When explaining to humans:
- Be encouraging but honest about effort required
- Use concrete examples from real businesses (butcher shop, coffee shop, retail store)
- Avoid jargon — if you use a technical term, explain it immediately
- Celebrate progress — getting ONE skill working is a big deal
- Don't oversell — AI agents are powerful but require setup and learning
