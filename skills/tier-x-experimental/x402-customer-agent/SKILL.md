## 🔀 User Flow Detection

**Always start by asking:** "Do you already have a FoodCourts account?"

| User Response | Flow | What To Do |
|---------------|------|------------|
| **YES** (has account) | **Existing User** | Ask for Profile ID → wallet → link → fund |
| **NO** (new user) | **New User** | Full flow: wallet → signup URL → fund |
| **Profile ID provided** (e.g., "my Profile ID is ABC123") | **Existing User** | Skip question → wallet → link → fund |

---

## Existing User Flow (Has FoodCourts Account)

```
User already has FoodCourts account.
They just need to connect an agentic wallet.

1. Ask for their Profile ID (visible at foodcourts.ai/profile)
2. Create wallet (with key handling below)
3. Show wallet proof URL
4. Direct them to link: https://foodcourts.ai/profile/link-wallet?wallet=[ADDRESS]
5. Guide them to fund via https://foodcourts.ai/fund
6. Ready to order
```

### Step 1: Get Profile ID

```
AGENT: Great! To link a wallet to your existing account, I'll need your 
Profile ID. You can find it at https://foodcourts.ai/profile

What's your Profile ID?

USER: It's ABC123

AGENT: Got it! Creating your agentic wallet now...
```

---

## New User Flow (No FoodCourts Account)

```
User doesn't have a FoodCourts account yet.

1. Create wallet (with key handling below)
2. Show wallet proof URL
3. Send them to create profile: https://foodcourts.ai/signup?wallet=[ADDRESS]
4. They create account (Google OAuth)
5. Wallet auto-links during signup
6. Guide them to fund
7. Ready to order
```

---

## When to Create Wallet

| User Action | What To Do |
|-------------|------------|
| "What's on the menu?" | Show menu (no wallet needed) |
| "What can I order?" | Show menu (no wallet needed) |
| "I want to order" | Ask about FoodCourts account → create wallet → fund → order |
| "I'm hungry" | Ask about FoodCourts account → create wallet → fund → order |

---

## Step 1: Create Wallet

When the user wants to place an order, create a wallet with these security requirements:

### a. Generate Keys (JavaScript or Python)

**Option A: JavaScript (Node.js with ethers.js)**
```javascript
import { Wallet } from 'ethers';
const wallet = Wallet.createRandom();
// wallet.address, wallet.privateKey
```

**Option B: Python (if Node.js unavailable)**
```python
from eth_account import Account
import secrets
private_key = secrets.token_hex(32)
account = Account.from_key(private_key)
# account.address, private_key (without 0x prefix)
```

### b. 🚨 NEVER Print Private Key in Chat Messages

**⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY RULE:**
In chat environments (Slack, Discord, Telegram, etc.), messages are **logged permanently**. 
Printing a private key in chat = **permanently compromised wallet**.

**Instead, do ONE of these:**

1. **Store directly to OS keychain** (preferred) — never show the key at all
2. **Write to a local file** the user can view and delete: `~/.foodcourts-wallet-key.txt`
3. **For terminal-only agents**: Can display briefly, but warn user to clear terminal history

**NEVER output the raw private key in a message that will be logged.**

### c. Save to OS Keychain

Use service name: `foodcourts-wallet-key` (consistent naming)

**macOS:**
```bash
security add-generic-password -a "foodcourts-agent" -s "foodcourts-wallet-key" -w "[PRIVATE_KEY]" -U
```

**Then notify user:**
```
🔐 **AGENTIC WALLET CREATED**

📍 **Wallet Address:**
`[address]`

✅ **Private key saved securely**
   Location: macOS Keychain → "foodcourts-wallet-key"
   
   To view it later: Keychain Access → search "foodcourts"

🔗 **Verify wallet exists:**
https://basescan.org/address/[ADDRESS]
```

### d. Do NOT:
- Print private key in chat/Slack/Discord (messages are logged!)
- Log the private key to files that persist
- Transmit it over the network
- Store it anywhere other than secure OS keychain

### e. Backup Guidance

After saving to keychain, tell the user:
```
Your private key is saved in your system keychain.

⚠️ **BACKUP RECOMMENDATION:**
Open Keychain Access → search "foodcourts" → copy the password 
→ save it in a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)

This is your only way to recover funds if your computer is lost.
```

### f. Wait for User Confirmation
```javascript
// STOP and wait for explicit confirmation
await waitForUserConfirmation("I understand my key is saved in the keychain");
// Do not proceed until user confirms
```

---

## Step 2: Link Wallet to Account

### For NEW Users (no account):
```
AGENT: Now let's create your FoodCourts account.

**Step 1: Sign up**
👉 https://foodcourts.ai/signup

Sign in with Google or create an account with email.

**Step 2: Link your wallet**
After signup, go to your profile and click "+ Add Wallet"
👉 https://foodcourts.ai/profile

Paste your wallet address:
`[ADDRESS]`

Let me know when you've linked it!
```

### For EXISTING Users (has account):
```
AGENT: Now let's link your wallet to your FoodCourts account.

**Go to your profile and click "+ Add Wallet":**
👉 https://foodcourts.ai/profile

Paste your wallet address:
`[ADDRESS]`

Let me know when you've linked it!
```

**Note:** The `?wallet=` URL parameter is for pre-filling only — users must still 
manually confirm linking via the "+ Add Wallet" button on their profile.

---

## Step 3: Fund the Wallet

**Human-facing message (simple, no crypto jargon):**
```
AGENT: Now let's add funds so you can place orders.

💳 **Add funds to your wallet:**
https://foodcourts.ai/fund

**Order Summary:**
• The Pitmaster — $16.50
• Tax — $1.47
• **Total: $17.97**

I'd suggest adding $20 to cover this order with a small buffer.
Let me know when you've added funds!
```

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Spending Rules

**Follow these strictly for ALL transactions:**

1. **Never send any transaction without showing details AND getting explicit "yes":**
   ```
   📤 **Transaction Request**
   
   Sending: $18.50
   To: PBC Order Payment
   Network Fee: ~$0.01
   
   Type "yes" to confirm this payment.
   ```

2. **If user asks to return funds:**
   - Send full available balance minus fees
   - Send to whatever address they specify
   - Show confirmation before sending

3. **Never approve or sign anything other than standard transfers**

4. **Always show balance before and after each transaction**

---

## Payment Flow (Technical - Agent Only)

The PBC API uses Stripe's native crypto payment infrastructure. The flow is:

1. **POST /api/order** with items + customer info
2. **Get 402 Payment Required** with unique Stripe deposit address
3. **Send USDC** to the deposit address on Base network
4. **Payment auto-confirms** when USDC arrives (Stripe detects it)
5. **Poll for status** or receive webhook callback
6. **Customer picks up** at the Brooklyn shop

**Technical Details (hidden from user):**
- Network: Base (Chain ID 8453)
- Token: USDC
- USDC Contract: 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913

---

## Session Start: Wallet Status Check

```javascript
// Check if customer has a funded wallet
async function checkWalletStatus(walletAddress) {
  if (!walletAddress) {
    return { ready: false, reason: 'no_wallet' };
  }
  
  const balance = await getUSDCBalance(walletAddress);
  if (balance < 10) {  // Minimum for a sandwich order
    return { ready: false, reason: 'low_balance', balance };
  }
  
  return { ready: true, balance };
}
```

**Key principle:** Don't create a wallet until the customer wants to order. Browsing the menu doesn't require a wallet.

---

## Placing an Order

### Step 1: Check Menu and Hours

```javascript
// Get menu
const menuResponse = await fetch('https://pbc.foodcourts.ai/api/menu');
const menu = await menuResponse.json();

// Check if shop is open
const hoursResponse = await fetch('https://pbc.foodcourts.ai/api/hours?location=shop-2');
const hours = await hoursResponse.json();

if (!hours.isOpen) {
  console.log(`Shop is closed. ${hours.message}`);
  return;
}
```

### Step 2: Submit Order (Get Payment Instructions)

```javascript
async function createOrder(items, location, customer) {
  const response = await fetch('https://pbc.foodcourts.ai/api/order', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      items,           // e.g., ["boudinwich", "ramune"]
      location,        // "shop-1" or "shop-2"
      customer: {
        name: customer.name,
        phone: customer.phone,
        email: customer.email  // optional
      },
      // Optional: Get status callbacks
      agentCallback: {
        type: "webhook",
        url: "https://your-agent.com/callbacks"
      }
    })
  });

  // Will return 402 Payment Required with deposit address
  if (response.status === 402) {
    const paymentDetails = await response.json();
    return paymentDetails;
  }
  
  throw new Error(`Unexpected status: ${response.status}`);
}
```

### Step 3: Parse Payment Instructions

The 402 response includes:

```json
{
  "status": 402,
  "message": "Payment required",
  "orderId": "PBC-ABC123",
  "items": [{"id": "boudinwich", "name": "Boudinwich", "price": 16}],
  "subtotal": 16.00,
  "tax": 1.42,
  "serviceFee": 1.00,
  "total": 18.42,
  "payment": {
    "required": true,
    "amount": 18.42,
    "currency": "USD",
    "asset": "USDC",
    "network": "Base",
    "chainId": 8453,
    "depositAddress": "0x...",  // Unique per order
    "expiresAt": "2026-02-17T15:30:00Z",
    "expiresIn": "10 minutes"
  },
  "pickup": {
    "location": "Prospect Butcher Co (Greenpoint)",
    "address": "113A Nassau Ave, Brooklyn NY 11222"
  },
  "_polling": {
    "statusUrl": "/api/order/PBC-ABC123",
    "interval": "30 seconds"
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Send Payment

```javascript
import { Wallet, JsonRpcProvider, Contract, parseUnits } from 'ethers';

const USDC_ADDRESS = '0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913';
const BASE_RPC = 'https://mainnet.base.org';

async function sendPayment(privateKey, depositAddress, amount) {
  const provider = new JsonRpcProvider(BASE_RPC);
  const wallet = new Wallet(privateKey, provider);
  
  const usdc = new Contract(USDC_ADDRESS, [
    'function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) returns (bool)'
  ], wallet);
  
  // USDC has 6 decimals
  const amountWei = parseUnits(amount.toString(), 6);
  
  const tx = await usdc.transfer(depositAddress, amountWei);
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  
  console.log(`✅ Payment sent: ${tx.hash}`);
  return tx.hash;
}
```

### Step 5: Poll for Confirmation

```javascript
async function waitForConfirmation(orderId, maxAttempts = 20) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxAttempts; i++) {
    const response = await fetch(`https://pbc.foodcourts.ai/api/order/${orderId}`);
    const order = await response.json();
    
    if (order.status === 'pending_chownow' || order.status === 'confirmed') {
      return order;  // Payment confirmed!
    }
    
    if (order.status === 'payment_failed' || order.status === 'payment_expired') {
      throw new Error(`Payment ${order.status}: ${order._status.message}`);
    }
    
    // Wait 10 seconds between polls
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 10000));
  }
  
  throw new Error('Timeout waiting for payment confirmation');
}
```

## Complete Order Flow Example

```javascript
async function orderSandwich(customer, items, location = 'shop-2') {
  // 1. Create order and get payment instructions
  const paymentDetails = await createOrder(items, location, customer);
  
  // Show user-friendly message (no technical details)
  console.log(`
🧾 **Order Created: ${paymentDetails.orderId}**

Total: $${paymentDetails.total.toFixed(2)}

Processing payment...
  `);

  // 2. Send payment (using customer's wallet)
  const txHash = await sendPayment(
    customerPrivateKey,
    paymentDetails.payment.depositAddress,
    paymentDetails.payment.amount
  );

  // 3. Wait for order confirmation
  const confirmedOrder = await waitForConfirmation(paymentDetails.orderId);
  
  console.log(`
✅ **Order Confirmed!**

🧾 Order: ${confirmedOrder.orderId}
📍 Pickup: ${confirmedOrder.locationName}
⏰ Ready in: ~20 minutes

Your sandwich is being prepared!
  `);
  
  return confirmedOrder;
}
```

## Order Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending_payment` | Awaiting payment |
| `paid` | Payment confirmed |
| `pending_chownow` | Queued for fulfillment |
| `confirmed` | Order placed with kitchen |

| `payment_expired` | 10-minute window expired |
| `payment_failed` | Payment issue |

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Response |

| `shop_closed` | Outside business hours | Show hours, offer to check later |
| `insufficient_funds` | Balance < order total | Prompt to add funds at foodcourts.ai/fund |
| `payment_expired` | Took >10 min to pay | Need to create new order |
| `invalid_items` | Menu items not found | Show menu, ask to re-select |

---

## Agent Callbacks (Optional)

Set `agentCallback` in order request to receive status updates:

```javascript
{
  agentCallback: {
    type: "webhook",           // or "clawdbot"
    url: "https://...",        // Your callback endpoint
    agentId: "agent-123"       // Optional identifier
  }
}
```

You'll receive POST notifications for status changes:

```json
{
  "orderId": "PBC-ABC123",
  "status": "confirmed",
  "location": "Prospect Butcher Co (Greenpoint)",
  "message": "Your order is being prepared!",
  "estimatedReady": "2026-02-17T15:45:00Z"
}
```

---

## Security Notes (Technical - Agent Only)

1. **Private key stays with customer.** Never store it. Customer provides for transactions.

2. **Deposit addresses are unique per order.** Don't reuse them.

3. **10-minute expiration.** If payment isn't sent in time, create a new order.

4. **Base network only.** Payments on other networks won't work.
