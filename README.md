## 🚀 Brand New to This?

**Step 1:** Copy this URL: `https://github.com/smb-pbc/agent-skills-public`

**Step 2:** Paste it into ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI chat

**Step 3:** Say: *"Read this and help me understand what AI agents can do for my small business. I'm completely new to this."*

That's it. The AI will read this page and guide you through everything — explained for your specific type of business.

## 💡 What You Might Not Know About AI

You've probably used ChatGPT or Claude. You type, it types back. It's helpful for questions and writing.

**But that's only 1% of what AI can do.**

Right now, your AI is like a really smart person stuck in a room with no phone, no computer, and no access to anything. They can talk to you through a slot in the door, but they can't actually DO anything.

**AI agents are different.** They can:
- Actually read your emails (not just talk about email)
- Actually check your sales numbers (not just suggest you check them)
- Actually pause that ad that's wasting money (not just tell you to pause it)
- Actually send that invoice reminder (not just draft it for you to copy-paste)

**This repo helps you get there.** It's a collection of "skills" — pre-built instructions that teach AI how to connect to and use your business tools.

## 🤔 How Does This Work?

Three things need to happen for AI to actually do things in your business:

| Step | What It Means | How Long |
|------|---------------|----------|
| 1. **AI runs somewhere with access** | Install a tool like Claude Code on your computer | 15 min |
| 2. **AI gets credentials** | Store API keys so AI can connect to Gmail, Square, etc. | 30 min |
| 3. **AI learns your tools** | Add "skills" that teach it how to use each service | 5 min each |

**This repo handles Step 3.** Steps 1-2 are one-time setup — the AI reading this can walk you through it.

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Need

To use these skills, you'll need one of these "CLI AI agents" (AI that runs on a computer, not just in a browser):

| Tool | Best For | Difficulty |
|------|----------|------------|
| [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Beginners, Mac/Linux users | Easy |
| [Clawdbot](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot) | Slack/Discord users, always-on agent | Medium |
| [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) | OpenAI/GPT users | Easy |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | Google ecosystem users | Easy |

**Don't have any of these yet?** That's fine. Ask the AI helping you to walk you through setting up Claude Code — it's free to start and takes about 15 minutes.

## 🎯 The Vision: From Chatbot to Business Operator

Most people use AI to answer questions. That's 1% of what's possible.

With the right skills installed, your AI agent becomes a business operator:

```
Level 0: Chatbot          → Just answers questions
Level 1: Connected        → Has API keys, can authenticate
Level 2: Communicator     → Reads email, manages calendar, posts to Slack
Level 3: Operator         → Pulls sales data, checks inventory, runs reports
Level 4: Marketer         → Manages ads, sends campaigns, creates content
Level 5: Autonomous       → Runs daily briefings, monitors health, chains workflows
```

**These skills get you from Level 0 to Level 5.**

### If you have Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI:
Copy the skill folder to your agent's workspace and reference the SKILL.md.

### If you just have ChatGPT/Claude chat:
You can't install skills directly, but you can:
1. Read the SKILL.md files — they contain all the knowledge
2. Ask your AI to follow the instructions in those files
3. Consider setting up a CLI agent (Claude Code is free to try)

These skills were built at [Prospect Butcher Co](https://prospectbutcher.co), a premium butcher shop in Brooklyn. We use AI agents to:
- Forecast daily revenue
- Manage Google Ads ($40/day, fully autonomous)
- Track inventory across locations
- Generate product content for Walmart Marketplace
